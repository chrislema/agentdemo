# Dimension to Motivation Mappings

Use this reference to:
1. Identify which motivations belong to each dimension
2. Determine **weakest dimensions** by looking at bottom 8-10 motivations

## Dimension → Related Motivations

| Dimension | Related Motivations |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Achiever** | Excel, Mastery, Evoke Recognition, Be Unique, Be Key, Maximize |
| **Driver** | Advance, Finish, Meet The Challenge, Overcome, Gain Ownership |
| **Influencer** | Persuade, Make An Impact, Identify Potential, Develop |
| **Learner** | Comprehend And Express, Demonstrate Learning, Explore, Mastery |
| **Optimizer** | Improve, Make It Work, Do It Right, Meet Requirements |
| **Orchestrator** | Systematize, Architect, Take Charge, Be Key, Establish |
| **Relator** | Meet Needs, Collaborate, Make The Team, Persuade |
| **Visionary** | Design, Experience The Ideal, Realize The Vision, Identify Potential |

## Determining Weakest Dimensions

1. Look at the **bottom 8-10 motivations** in the full ranking
2. Map each to its dimension using the table above
3. Dimensions with multiple low-ranked motivations are the weakest
4. Typically identify 2 weakest dimensions

### Example Analysis

If bottom 8 motivations are:
- Maximize (#28) → Achiever
- Architect (#29) → Orchestrator  
- Systematize (#30) → Orchestrator
- Finish (#31) → Driver
- Meet Requirements (#32) → Optimizer

**Weakest dimensions**: Orchestrator (2 motivations), Optimizer, Driver

## Notes

- Some motivations appear in multiple dimensions (e.g., Be Key in both Achiever and Orchestrator)
- Mastery appears in both Achiever and Learner
- Persuade appears in both Influencer and Relator
- Identify Potential appears in both Influencer and Visionary

When a motivation spans dimensions, consider the context from achievement stories to determine which dimension is more relevant.
