# Audience Framework

How to identify the specific micro-segment you're writing to and verify your topic connects to their goals. Every piece of content is written to one micro-segment only.

---

## The One-Audience Rule

When you pick an audience, you're picking one micro-segment within one segment. When you evaluate a topic, you're checking which micro-segment's goals or pain maps bestâ€”and you're looking for the strongest connection, not a good-enough connection.

The moment you try to write to multiple micro-segments, your message loses its edge. The psychological triggers won't land. The mental pictures will blur. The headline will try to please everyone and compel no one.

**One pyramid. One message. One micro-segment.**

## Why Segments Are Too Broad

Typical segmentation says: "High-end travelers, business travelers, family travelers."

But Hilton has 13 different hotels in Chicago alone. Why? Because "business traveler" isn't one audience:
- Some need breakfast, others need full restaurants
- Some need meeting rooms to rent
- Some need proximity to downtown, others want the lakefront
- Some need gyms and late checkout

**The goal of segmentation is communication and predictability.** A single message can drive action, but only if the members of the micro-segment are aligned. At the segment level, it's too broad and the message loses its edge.

---

## What Is a Micro-Segment?

A micro-segment is a group small enough and aligned enough that:
- **One message resonates with everyone in the group**
- **Their goals stack coherently** (even if individuals stop at different levels)
- **You can predict their response** to specific content

**Segment:** Business travelers
**Micro-segment:** Road warriors who prioritize gym access, laundry service, and late checkout

**Segment:** SaaS founders
**Micro-segment:** Technical founders building their first SaaS who want to validate quickly without hiring

**Segment:** Marketing professionals
**Micro-segment:** Solo marketing consultants serving B2B tech companies who struggle with content consistency

The micro-segment is specific enough that you can see their face, hear their complaints, and predict what they'll click on.

---

## The Goal Pyramid

Every micro-segment is climbing toward something. The Goal Pyramid represents the hierarchy of goals they're pursuing.

### How It Works

Everyone in the micro-segment shares the same pyramid structure, but they don't all climb to the topâ€”and that's fine.

```
        â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”
        â”‚  Meeting Rooms  â”‚  â† Level 3: Some executives need this
        â”‚    to Rent      â”‚
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
        â”‚   Restaurant    â”‚  â† Level 2: More executives need this
        â”‚  for Client     â”‚
        â”‚    Dinners      â”‚
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
        â”‚    Central      â”‚  â† Level 1: All executives need this
        â”‚   Location      â”‚
        â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
```

- **Executive A** only cares about central location (stops at Level 1)
- **Executive B** needs central location AND a restaurant (stops at Level 2)
- **Executive C** needs all three (climbs to Level 3)

**Key insight:** All three executives understand and respond to the same messaging because they're on the same pyramid. They just stop at different levels.

### When It's a Different Pyramid

The moment the goals change fundamentally, you're in a different micro-segment.

**Road Warrior Pyramid:**
```
        â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”
        â”‚  Late Checkout  â”‚
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
        â”‚    Laundry      â”‚
        â”‚    Service      â”‚
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
        â”‚   Great Gym     â”‚
        â”‚   (Open Early)  â”‚
        â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
```

Notice: No restaurant. No meeting rooms. No central location. Completely different goals = completely different pyramid = completely different micro-segment = completely different message.

**Rule:** Same pyramid = same micro-segment. Different pyramid = different micro-segment.

## Building Pyramids from Your Audience

### Step 1: Look at the Goals List
Your audience definition has goals. Not all apply to every person in the segmentâ€”that's the clue that there are micro-segments within.

### Step 2: Identify Goal Clusters
Look for goals that naturally stack:
- Which goals are foundational (everyone wants these)?
- Which goals build on the foundational ones?
- Which goals are advanced (only some people pursue these)?

### Step 3: Build the Pyramid
Stack the goals where:
- **Base level**: Universal goal everyone in this micro-segment shares
- **Middle levels**: Progressive goals that build on the base
- **Top level**: Advanced goal that not everyone reaches

### Step 4: Validate with Pains
Check the painsâ€”they should map to the goals. If someone complains about X, they care about achieving the opposite of X.

### Example: From Goals List to Pyramid

Goals list for "Technical Founders":
- Get first paying customers
- Learn to market without feeling slimy
- Build a marketing system that works
- Understand pricing strategy
- Achieve product-market fit
- Build sustainable revenue
- Create a growth engine
- Transition from "developer" to "founder"

These cluster into a pyramid:
```
        â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”
        â”‚  Sustainable    â”‚  â† Level 4: Growth engine
        â”‚  Growth Engine  â”‚
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
        â”‚  Repeatable     â”‚  â† Level 3: Know what works
        â”‚  Acquisition    â”‚
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
        â”‚  Product-Market â”‚  â† Level 2: Validation
        â”‚  Fit            â”‚
        â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¤
        â”‚  First Paying   â”‚  â† Level 1: Prove it's possible
        â”‚  Customers      â”‚
        â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
```

## The Inverted Pain Pyramid

Sometimes the Goals list is too broad or vague. Use the Pains list insteadâ€”pain is often more specific and honest.

### Pain Reveals Goals

People express pain more readily than they articulate goals:
- They don't say "I want a hotel with a great gym"
- They say "The gym was closed at 6am" or "The treadmills were broken"

**What they complain about is what they care about.**

### Inverting Pains to Goals

Take pains and flip them:

| Pain | Inverted Goal |
|------|---------------|
| "Can't get anyone to notice my product" | Get attention/visibility |
| "Marketing feels foreign and uncomfortable" | Learn to market authentically |
| "Burning through savings" | Achieve sustainable revenue |
| "Watching competitors get more traction" | Win in the market |

Stack these inverted goals into a pyramid, and you have your goal pyramid.

---

## The Scoring Process

### Step 1: State Your Topic
Clearly articulate what you want to write about.

### Step 2: List Your Segments
Open your audience definition. List the segments you serve.

### Step 3: Score Each Segment
For each segment:
1. Identify which Goals and Pains your topic connects to
2. Build a goal pyramid from those connected goals (3-5 levels)
3. Identify the micro-segment within this segment that the topic speaks to
4. Score the fit (1-5)
5. Suggest the angle that would resonate most

### Step 4: Select Your Audience
Choose the highest-scoring segment and identify the specific micro-segment within it.

---

## Scoring Rubric

| Score | Meaning | Criteria |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **5 - Perfect** | Topic directly addresses their primary goal | Hits the base AND upper levels of their pyramid |
| **4 - Strong** | Topic strongly connects to their pyramid | Clearly relevant, may not hit every level |
| **3 - Good** | Topic connects but isn't core to their pyramid | Interesting to them, but not urgent |
| **2 - Weak** | Topic is tangential to their goals | They'd read it, but it's not for them |
| **1 - No Fit** | Topic doesn't connect to their pyramid | Wrong audience entirely |

---

## Scoring Edge Cases

### Topic Fits Multiple Segments Equally
This usually means:
1. Your segments aren't distinct enough
2. The topic is too broad and needs narrowing
3. You need to choose an angle that favors one segment

**Solution:** Pick one and commit. You can write a different piece for the other segment later with a different angle.

### Topic Doesn't Fit Any Segment
This means:
1. The topic doesn't serve your audience (kill it or save it for later)
2. You've discovered a new segment you should add
3. The topic needs significant reframing

**Solution:** Don't force it. Either reshape the topic or acknowledge it's not the right time for this content.

### High Score But Low Enthusiasm
Sometimes a topic scores well but you feel reluctant to write it.

**Solution:** Check your voice profile. Does this topic align with your authentic expertise? If not, the high score doesn't matterâ€”the content will feel forced.

---

## Quality Control

Before moving forward, confirm:

- [ ] **Segment Selected**: You've chosen ONE segment for this piece
- [ ] **Micro-Segment Identified**: You know the specific sub-group within that segment
- [ ] **Pyramid Built**: You can articulate their 3-5 level goal pyramid
- [ ] **Topic Scored**: Your topic scores 4+ for this micro-segment
- [ ] **Angle Clear**: You know what aspect of the topic connects to their pyramid

## Red Flags

**Stop and reassess if:**
- You can't decide between segments (topic too broad or segments too similar)
- Your topic scores 3 or below for all segments
- You can't build a coherent goal pyramid
- The angle feels forced
- You're excited about the topic but not about the audience (or vice versa)

---

## Output of This Stage

By the end of audience analysis, you should have:

1. **Your Selected Segment** - From your audience definition
2. **The Micro-Segment** - The specific sub-group within that segment
3. **Their Goal Pyramid** - Built from their Goals and Pains
4. **Your Topic Score** - 4+ fit with their pyramid
5. **Your Angle** - How this topic connects to their pyramid
