## Advanced Structural Strategies

### The Progression Build
Use structures in sequence throughout your content:
1. **Open** with Controversy or Myth-Killing (attention)
2. **Build** with Storytelling or Mistake Confession (trust)
3. **Develop** through Framework Building (value)
4. **Climax** with Insight Generation (transformation)
5. **Close** with Future Pacing or Call-to-Action (action)

### Context Adaptation
Modify intensity based on audience:
- **Senior Leaders**: Emphasize strategic paradoxes and systematic thinking
- **Individual Contributors**: Focus on practical roadmaps and visual tools
- **Cross-functional Teams**: Use "Best of Both Worlds" to resolve competing priorities

### The Brief Test
Before drafting, complete this sentence for each section:
"In this section, I will [VERB] the reader by [METHOD] so they [OUTCOME]."

Example: "In the Case Studies section, I will convince the reader by showing three specific failures so they believe my alternative is worth trying."
