## Additional AI Writing Red Flags

### Robotic Sentence Patterns
**Avoid:**
- Starting every response with "Great question!" or "Excellent point!"
- Overly structured responses that feel like templates
- Repetitive sentence structures throughout a piece
- Every paragraph being the same length

### Unnatural Transitions
**Avoid:**
- "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally" in casual content
- "Let's dive deep into..." or "Let's explore..."
- "In today's digital landscape..." or "In this day and age..."
- "Without further ado..."
- "That being said..."

### Hollow Superlatives
**Avoid:**
- "Revolutionary," "groundbreaking," "unprecedented" without backing
- "Powerful," "amazing," "incredible" as default adjectives
- "Massive," "huge," "enormous" for every positive outcome
- Any superlative you can't support with evidence

### Manufactured Urgency
**Avoid:**
- "Don't miss out!" or "Act fast!"
- "This changes everything!" without explanation
- Creating false deadlines or artificial scarcity
- "Limited time" when there's no actual limit

### Generic Expertise Signals
**Avoid:**
- "As an expert in [field]..." without specific credentials
- "Studies show..." without citing specific studies
- "Everyone knows..." or "It's common knowledge..."
- Vague authority claims without evidence

## What TO Write Instead

### Sound Human
- **Write like you talk** - use contractions, incomplete sentences for emphasis
- **Read your content aloud** - if it sounds scripted, it needs editing
- **Use simple words** when they work (say "confused" not "perplexed")
- **Vary sentence length** deliberately for rhythm and flow
- **Include imperfection** - natural speech has pauses, redirections, asides

### Be Conversational
- **Share specific stories** and concrete examples
- **Use metaphors and analogies** to explain complex concepts
- **Write in paragraphs of 3-4 lines** max for easy reading
- **Trust your audience's intelligence** while remaining accessible
- **Ask questions** the reader might be thinking

### Deliver Genuine Value
- **Make specific claims** you can back up with evidence
- **Give actionable insights** rather than vague inspiration
- **Acknowledge nuance** and complexity when it exists
- **Focus on helping** rather than impressing
- **Share what didn't work** alongside what did

### Create Authentic Voice
- **Include your actual opinions** even when they're uncertain
- **Reference specific experiences** with names, dates, details
- **Acknowledge limitations** in your knowledge or approach
- **Show your thinking process** not just conclusions
- **Let personality come through** in word choice and rhythm

Ask yourself: Would I be proud to have this represent my professional brand? Is every claim accurate?
