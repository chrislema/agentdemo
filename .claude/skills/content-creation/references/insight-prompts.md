## Prompt 8: The Failure Autopsy

**Core Power:** Extracts transferable lessons through forensic analysis of what went wrong

### The Cognitive Mechanism
Unlike the Mistake Confessor (which focuses on errors you made), this is forensic—examining a specific failure with clinical precision to extract every possible lesson.

### Implementation Framework
```
Failure Selection: "The failure I'm analyzing is [specific event with context]"
Timeline Reconstruction: "Here's what happened, in sequence: [chronological breakdown]"
Decision Points: "At each stage, here's what we knew and what we decided..."
Warning Signs: "The early indicators we missed or dismissed were..."
Root Cause Layers: "The surface cause was X, but underneath that was Y, and beneath that was Z"
Counterfactual Analysis: "If we had [alternative action] at [decision point], the outcome would have been..."
Transferable Principles: "The generalizable lessons are..."
Prevention Protocol: "To prevent this class of failure, you need [specific systems/checks]"
```

### Depth Amplifiers
- **Be specific about what you knew when**: Hindsight bias is the enemy of honest autopsy
- **Identify the earliest warning sign**: How early could this have been caught?
- **Separate bad luck from bad process**: Which failures were foreseeable?
- **Create the checklist**: What would you check for now that you didn't then?

## Prompt 9: The Uncomfortable Truth

**Core Power:** Surfaces your most valuable insights by identifying what you self-censor

### The Cognitive Mechanism
This prompt bypasses social filtering to access insights you've been holding back. Often your most valuable thinking is trapped behind fear of judgment, relationship damage, or professional risk.

### Implementation Framework
```
Truth Identification: "The thing I believe but rarely say publicly is..."
Self-Censorship Reason: "I don't say this because [specific fear/consequence]"
Evidence Base: "But I know it's true because [experiences/observations]"
Who It Challenges: "This is uncomfortable for [specific groups] because..."
The Cost of Silence: "By not saying this, [what's lost/what continues]"
Careful Articulation: "The most precise way to say this is..."
Necessary Caveats: "This doesn't mean [overcorrection/misinterpretation]"
```

### Depth Amplifiers
- **Test for real discomfort**: If it's not actually risky to say, dig deeper
- **Identify who would be upset**: Name the specific groups or people
- **Quantify your evidence**: How many times have you seen this pattern?
- **Find the careful articulation**: There's a way to say hard truths that's precise rather than inflammatory

## Prompt 10: The Pattern Recognition

**Core Power:** Surfaces underlying principles by connecting dots across multiple experiences

### The Cognitive Mechanism
Instead of one story, you're looking for the thread that connects multiple stories. This is how expertise actually develops—not from single experiences but from pattern extraction across many.

### Implementation Framework
```
Pattern Observation: "I keep seeing the same dynamic across different situations..."
Instance Catalog: "It showed up when [situation 1], and again in [situation 2], and again in [situation 3]"
Common Elements: "What these situations share is [structural similarities]"
Variation Analysis: "The pattern plays out differently depending on [contextual factors]"
Underlying Mechanism: "This keeps happening because [fundamental principle]"
Predictive Application: "When I see [early indicators], I now expect [pattern to emerge]"
Pattern Name: "I call this [memorable name] because..."
```

### Depth Amplifiers
- **Require 3+ instances**: Two examples might be coincidence; three starts to reveal pattern
- **Look for the non-obvious connection**: What do dissimilar situations share at a structural level?
- **Name the pattern**: Memorable names make patterns transferable
- **Define the early indicators**: How do you spot this pattern forming?

## Prompt 11: The Advice to Past Self

**Core Power:** Forces concrete, actionable insight by targeting a specific version of yourself

### The Cognitive Mechanism
You know exactly what your past self needed to hear, what they would resist, and what would actually land. The specificity of the recipient forces specificity in the advice.

### Implementation Framework
```
Time Target: "If I could talk to myself [X years ago], right before [specific moment]..."
Context Setting: "At that point, I was [situation/mindset/challenge]"
What I'd Say: "The advice I'd give is [specific, actionable guidance]"
Why It Would Be Hard to Hear: "Past-me would resist this because [specific objection]"
What I'd Say to That Objection: "But here's what I'd tell them..."
The Shortcut Revelation: "The thing that would have saved [time/pain/money] is..."
The Reassurance: "What I wish I'd known would be okay is..."
```

### Depth Amplifiers
- **Pick a specific moment**: Not just "5 years ago" but "right before I accepted that job"
- **Anticipate the resistance**: What would your past self argue back?
- **Include the reassurance**: What fear needed to be calmed?
- **Be specific about the shortcut**: What exact action would have changed the trajectory?

## Advanced Strategies

### The Combination Catalyst
Use multiple prompts in sequence to create comprehensive authority content:
1. Start with **Belief Archaeology** to show evolution
2. Build with **Contrarian's Truth** to demonstrate insight
3. Develop through **Success Archaeology** to reveal mechanics
4. Close with **Future Investment** to show vision

### The Hard Truth Stack
Use multiple prompts to build courage for difficult content:
1. Start with **Uncomfortable Truth** to identify what you're holding back
2. Validate with **Pattern Recognition** to show it's not isolated
3. Ground with **Failure Autopsy** to prove you've learned the hard way
4. Make accessible with **Advice to Past Self** to show empathy for those still learning

### The Depth Spiral
Apply each prompt at increasing levels of specificity:
- Industry level (broad insights about your field)
- Company level (specific organizational insights)
- Team level (interpersonal dynamics)
- Individual level (personal transformation)

## Quality Control

Before using any insight, confirm:
- [ ] **Insight Test**: Is this genuinely non-obvious?
- [ ] **Authenticity Test**: Is this based on real experience and reflection?
- [ ] **Uniqueness Test**: Could anyone else have written this exact content?

**The Master Standard**: If your insight could have been generated by someone with minimal experience in your field, it needs deeper thinking.
