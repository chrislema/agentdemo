## Format 11: The Anti-Advice

**Core Promise:** Clarity through prohibition—what NOT to do

**Best For:** When prohibitions are clearer than prescriptions

**The Psychology:** The brain processes "don't do X" differently than "do Y." Prohibitions create bright lines that are easier to follow than nuanced guidance. Anti-advice also creates relief—you're removing things from their plate, not adding to it.

**Use When:**
- You've seen the same mistakes repeatedly
- The wrong actions are clearer than the right ones
- You want to create immediate behavior change
- Your audience is overwhelmed with advice about what TO do

**Template Prompt:** "What are the [5-7] things people should immediately stop doing in [area]? For each, explain why it seems right but backfires, and what happens when they stop."

**Examples:**
- "7 things to stop doing in 1:1s immediately"
- "The 5 practices I've banned from my engineering teams"
- "Stop doing these 6 things in code reviews"
- "What I tell every new manager to stop doing on day one"

**Structural Notes:**
- Lead with the prohibition, then explain the counterintuitive reason
- Include what typically happens when people stop (the positive outcome)
- Acknowledge why people do these things in the first place

## Format 12: The Day-in-the-Life

**Core Promise:** See how excellence actually operates, not just what it says

**Best For:** When showing beats telling

**The Psychology:** People are endlessly curious about how successful people actually spend their time. This format satisfies voyeuristic curiosity while providing practical modeling. It's descriptive rather than prescriptive, which bypasses resistance.

**Use When:**
- You have a role or routine others aspire to
- The gap between "advice" and "reality" matters
- You want to build relatability and authenticity
- Theory isn't landing—people need to see it in practice

**Template Prompt:** "Walk through a specific [day/week/sprint] in your role. What actually happens? Include the mundane, the unexpected, and the decisions you make. Show the thinking behind the doing."

**Examples:**
- "What my Tuesday actually looks like as an engineering director"
- "How I spend the first 90 minutes of every workday"
- "A week in the life of a startup CTO: the unfiltered version"
- "What happens in the 24 hours after a production incident on my team"

**Structural Notes:**
- Use specific times and concrete details
- Include interruptions, pivots, and imperfect moments
- Show decision-making in real-time, not just outcomes
- Avoid making it aspirational—make it real

## Format 13: The Evolution Story

**Core Promise:** Wisdom through witnessed change over time

**Best For:** When your current view is the result of significant iteration

**The Psychology:** Showing how your thinking evolved over time builds more credibility than stating your current position. It demonstrates intellectual humility, learning capacity, and depth of experience. Readers trust people who've changed their minds based on evidence.

**Use When:**
- Your current approach is different from where you started
- You've been in the game long enough to have multiple "eras"
- The evolution itself contains lessons
- You want to preempt "easy for you to say" objections

**Template Prompt:** "How has your approach to [topic] changed over [timeframe]? Identify 3-5 distinct phases. For each phase, explain what you believed, why it made sense then, and what changed your mind."

**Examples:**
- "How my approach to technical interviews evolved over 200 hires"
- "The 4 stages of my thinking on remote work"
- "What I believed about engineering culture in year 1, year 5, and year 10"
- "My hiring philosophy: the 3 complete rewrites"

**Structural Notes:**
- Name each phase distinctly (makes it memorable)
- Include what triggered each transition
- Be honest about what you got wrong
- End with current state + acknowledgment it may evolve again

## Format 14: The Single Case Deep Dive

**Core Promise:** Maximum depth, maximum learning from one story

**Best For:** When you have full access to a rich, instructive example

**The Psychology:** One deeply-examined case often teaches more than many surface-level examples. Deep dives satisfy the desire for completeness and demonstrate analytical rigor. They're also harder to dismiss because the specificity makes them credible.

**Use When:**
- You have insider access to a story worth telling in full
- The details themselves contain the lessons
- Surface-level treatment would miss the point
- You want to demonstrate analytical depth

**Template Prompt:** "Tell the complete story of [specific event/project/failure/success]. Include timeline, decisions made, information available at each point, what you got right, what you got wrong, and what you'd do differently."

**Examples:**
- "The complete story of how we recovered from a 6-hour outage"
- "Inside our failed product launch: every decision we made wrong"
- "The 18-month architecture migration: a full postmortem"
- "How we lost our best engineer and what we learned rebuilding"

**Structural Notes:**
- Use chronological structure with clear phases
- Include what you knew (and didn't know) at each decision point
- Don't sanitize—include mistakes and confusion
- Draw explicit lessons but let the story do most of the work
