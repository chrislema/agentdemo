# Content Creation System

A modular system for creating high-impact content. Load only the reference files needed for your task.

## Quick Reference: Which Files to Load

| Task | Load These Files |
|------|------------------|
| **Write a hook/headline** | `headline-formulas.md`, `psychological-triggers.md`, `audience-framework.md` |
| **Choose content format** | `content-formats.md`, `audience-framework.md` |
| **Structure a piece** | `content-structures.md`, `messaging-frameworks.md` |
| **Draft content** | `psychological-triggers.md`, `story-architecture.md`, `messaging-frameworks.md` |
| **Generate ideas from interview/source** | `insight-prompts.md`, `audience-framework.md` |
| **Polish/edit for authenticity** | `ai-red-flags.md` |
| **Full content piece** | All relevant files for the workflow below |

## Workflow: Creating a Complete Piece

### Phase 1: Audience & Angle
Load: `references/audience-framework.md`

1. Identify the micro-segment (not just segment)
2. Build their goal pyramid
3. Score topic fit (must be 4+)
4. Define the angle that connects to their pyramid

### Phase 2: Format & Structure Selection
Load: `references/content-formats.md`, `references/content-structures.md`

1. Choose format based on your insight type and goal
2. Match structure to format
3. Select messaging framework to layer on

### Phase 3: Hook Creation
Load: `references/headline-formulas.md`, `references/psychological-triggers.md`

1. Select 2-3 headline formulas that fit your angle
2. Draft multiple variations
3. Stack formulas for maximum impact
4. Verify hook triggers appropriate psychological mechanism

### Phase 4: Drafting
Load: `references/story-architecture.md`, `references/psychological-triggers.md`, `references/messaging-frameworks.md`

1. Apply story mechanics: Gap, Stakes, Progression, Specificity, Transformation
2. Use Therefore/But connections (never "and then")
3. Map psychological triggers to story beats
4. Layer messaging framework throughout

### Phase 5: Polish
Load: `references/ai-red-flags.md`

1. Scan for the 13 AI phrases
2. Read aloud test
3. Specificity sweep
4. Promise check (does content deliver what headline promised?)

## Workflow: Generating Ideas from Source Material

Load: `references/insight-prompts.md`, `references/audience-framework.md`

When working with interview transcripts, expert conversations, or raw source material:

1. **Surface the invisible pattern**: Use Pattern Recognition, Success Archaeology, or Belief Archaeology prompts
2. **Find the uncomfortable truth**: Use Uncomfortable Truth or Contrarian's Truth prompts
3. **Extract the transferable lesson**: Use Failure Autopsy or Advice to Past Self prompts
4. **Connect to audience**: Score against goal pyramid

The insight the expert provides may not be the insight the content uses. Your job is finding the case they didn't know they were making.

## Workflow: Podcast Episode Scripting

Load: `references/story-architecture.md`, `references/psychological-triggers.md`, `references/insight-prompts.md`

1. **Extract patterns** from source material using insight prompts
2. **Choose story shape**: Chronological Arc, In Medias Res, Contrast Reveal, Nested Story, or Parallel Track
3. **Map the 6 beats**: Hook (10%), Lock-In (10-25%), Progression (25-70%), Turn (70-80%), Resolution (80-90%), Meaning (90-100%)
4. **Assign triggers to beats** per the Story Architecture beat-trigger mapping
5. **Apply Therefore/But engine** to all transitions

## Reference Files

All files located in `references/` directory:

- `headline-formulas.md` - 13 headline patterns with neurological triggers

- `content-structures.md` - 10 structural outlines with section breakdowns
- `messaging-frameworks.md` - 8 persuasive frameworks with templates
- `psychological-triggers.md` - 11 brain mechanisms with implementation guides
- `insight-prompts.md` - 11 prompts for generating original thinking
- `story-architecture.md` - Narrative mechanics: 5 story mechanics, 5 shapes, beat mapping

## Key Principles

**One audience per piece.** Every piece targets one micro-segment. The moment you try to write to multiple audiences, your message loses its edge.

**Specificity over abstraction.** Numbers, names, sensory details. "87%" beats "nearly 90%". "Tuesday at 2:47 PM" beats "one day".

**Therefore/But, never "and then."** Every transition should be consequence (therefore) or contradiction (but). If you can replace the connection with "and then" and the story still works, the story is broken.

**Triggers at beats.** Psychological triggers fire at specific story moments. Hook uses Zeigarnik/Biology. Lock-In uses Identity/Hidden Problem. Turn uses Breaking False Beliefs.

**The authenticity test.** If it sounds like AI wrote it, rewrite it. Read aloud. Would you say this to a colleague?
